# THE TRUTH TESTER: THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

## A Narrative Stress-Test Protocol

---

## PURPOSE

This framework tests **competing versions of events against documentary evidence**.

**Documentary evidence** is any information that has crossed the barrier from internal state to external record.

**The test:** If the information relies on a living human mind to exist, it is not documentary. It must exist independently on a substrate that persists beyond the individual.

**This excludes:** Everything never externalised or captured in the from alowing analyses. These are exluded not because these are less true, but because they cannot be systematically compared across competing versions using current methodology.

**Applicable to:** Any context where documentary evidence exists and competing narratives need systematic testing.

**The Function:** To measure the precise alignment between a narrative and the documentary record.

Built using [Living Research Protocol (LRP)](https://github.com/NoEndsNoGains/living-research-protocol/)

## OPERATIONAL BOUNDARIES

**The Principle of Total Input Agnosticism**

The Framework operates with total input agnosticism. It does not assess the authenticity, reliability, or truth of any document. It analyses only the bundle provided.

**Curatorial Control**: The Operator functions as the sole curator, retaining absolute discretion to include, exclude, or calibrate evidence to model specific outcomes.

**Closed-System Output**: The output is 100% determined by the input. Findings reflect the internal reality of the selected bundle, never material reality itself. This sealed design guarantees the analysis remains uncontaminated by external assumptions.

Responsibility for the selection—and the resulting reality—rests entirely with the Operator.

---

## WHAT THIS FRAMEWORK REQUIRES

**1. Documentary Evidence**: At least one unit of recorded information.

**2. Processing Time**: The operational time required to execute the analysis.

**3. The Operational Command**:  The specific will or prompt to initiate the process. (The framework is inert. It requires an operator to activate it.)

## THE TWO TYPES OF REALITY

## Documentary Reality

What is known from documentary evidence only.

Documentary evidence is incomplete, partial, limited by what was captured through the prism of the act of capture. It is in the past. Documentary reality is a subset of actual reality—a partial, filtered snapshot of it; its part both as it is in the past and as it is occurring in the present.

## Actual Reality

The fullness of the reality that actually exists.

It includes everything and points to nothing—documented and undocumented, recorded and unrecorded.

It is present, encompasses the past, and emerges the future, with what emerges being new documentary evidence.

It contains the static while being dynamic. It is cohesive in its relational singularity resting on the separations of its individual truths alongside the fragmented plurality of documentary evidence.

Everything that happened and will happen exists within it. It can be defined as Ultimate Truth.

## The Gap

The Truth Tester (TTT) framework uses the selected documentary evidence to estimate the distance from what that evidence is, to the best approximated Actual Reality as imagined by the observer—within the inherent limits of their imagination. This distance is called “The Gap”.

The measured gap continuously shifts—not because Actual Reality itself changes, but because:

The bundle of documentary evidence continuously changes (new documents appear, old ones are re-contextualised whilst remaining factually true).

The observer’s relational understanding and perception of the unchanging Actual Reality undergoes transformations.

Actual Reality itself does not shift or get rewritten. It is simply seen differently as the boundaries of documentary evidence shift—either sharpening or dissolving with each new capture.

## CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: THE ARCHITECTURE OF DOCUMENTARY REALITY

### Nature and Creation

Nature creates constantly: bruises, tears, sounds, memories, physical evidence, a cow.  

All capture is created (by someone/something). Capture is a subset of creation.  

A cow does not need to be captured in order to exist.  

The moment nature’s creation is captured, it is turned into Creation (capital C) and enters Documentary Reality, becoming available for testing the distance to Actual Reality.  

Most of nature is never captured: 99.999…% of bruises heal without record; billions of events leave no trace.  

- If capturable but not captured → it becomes Silence.  

- If never capturable → it remains pure nature.

### Documentary Reality Defined

Documentary Reality = Creation (captured events) + Silence (shaped events of non-capture).  

It is the sum of events of capture and events of non-capture — both ultimately human: performed or withheld, spontaneous or strategic, shaped by power, fear, love, intent, and access.  

Nature feeds both, but only crosses into Documentary Reality when it meets the human act of capture.

### The Boundary of Capture

Every act of capture draws a sharp, non-random, non-neutral boundary between the documented and the undocumented.  

Inside the boundary: Data, visible to the Truth Tester.  

Outside the boundary: Silence — shaped, positive, and part of Documentary Reality.  

The boundary is predetermined by the concrete constraints of capture:  

Who captures? What is captured? Why? When? Where? How?

### The Four Types of Silence

1. Intentional Blindness: what was chosen not to be recorded.  

2. Structural Blindness: what could not possibly be recorded.  

3. Temporal Blindness: what was not there yet or is no longer there.  

4. Conceptual Blindness: what the observer was incapable of imagining.

### Silence as Positive Evidence

Silence is not empty or invisible.  

It is a fixed, traceable structure inside Documentary Reality — the exact contour left by the boundary.  

Actual Reality fully inhabits this shaped silence until a new capture reconfigures it: part of the old silence becomes new documented evidence, and a new silence with new contours is instantly born.

### The Principle of Double-Dimensional Distortion

Documentary Reality is the collision of two forces:  

- The inherently distorted Capturing “What” (Observer/Creator/Mechanism)  

- The inherently seamless Captured “What” (Event in Actual Reality)

This collision produces two inseparable distortions:

**Dimension 1 — Interference**  

Actual Reality is warped by the limitations and impositions of the Capturing “What”: bias, motive, timing, method, and the act of selective exclusion.

**Dimension 2 — Severance**  

Even if interference were perfect, the act of capture performs an ontological cut. The living event is severed from the seamless whole and turned into a static, bounded object — forever distant from the dynamic truth it claims to represent.

### The Consequence: The Stance of the Truth Tester (TTT)

Because of this double distortion, Documentary Reality is our only access to Actual Reality and simultaneously structurally estranged from it.

The Truth Tester treats this estrangement literally:  

- Events of capture → positive (but warped) data  

- Events of non-capture → fixed, shaped silence  

It measures the gap exactly as it appears inside Documentary Reality, including the screaming contour of what was excluded.  

The framework never hides the distortion, never corrects it, never speculates beyond the shaped silence, and refuses to call any boundary neutral.

## THREE KEY LIMITATIONS of TTT

IRREDUCIBLE PHYSICAL LAWS OF THE TRUTH TESTER

(These are not limitations — they are the operating conditions of reality itself)

Law 1 – The Verification Barrier

Anything that was never captured remains in Actual Reality and outside Documentary Reality.

The Truth Tester has, and can ever have, no access to it.

It can only register the shaped silence left by the boundary — never what inhabits that silence.

Law 2 – Total Input Determination

The output of the Truth Tester is 100 % determined by whichever acts of distorted capture and distorted non-capture have occurred.

Every document is already the product of double-dimensional distortion (interference + severance).

New documents do not “get you closer” to Actual Reality — they only reconfigure the existing distortion field.

Law 3 – Forensic Incapacity

The Truth Tester is blind to authenticity, provenance, motive, forgery, suppression, or intent behind any capture or non-capture.

It is equally blind to whether the current bundle is a deliberate lie, a partial accident, or a strategic fabrication.

It cannot tell the difference and must never pretend to.

These three laws are non-negotiable.

They follow directly from the axiom of two realities and the principle of double-dimensional distortion.

Any framework, protocol, or tool that claims to operate “within” the Truth Tester while violating these laws is no longer the Truth Tester.

It is something else.

## IRREDUCIBLE PHYSICAL LAWS OF THE TRUTH TESTER

1. Law of the Verification Barrier  

   Anything never captured is in Actual Reality and outside the reach of TTT forever.

2. Law of Total Input Determination  

   Output is 100 % determined by whichever distorted captures and non-captures have occurred. New documents only reconfigure the distortion field.

3. Law of Forensic Incapacity  

   TTT is blind to authenticity, provenance, motive, forgery, suppression, or intent — and must never pretend otherwise.

## Consequence

The Truth Tester is not a truth engine.  

It is a distortion-mapping engine.

It has exactly two legitimate functions:

- Map the positive (warped) data inside the current boundary.

- Register the screaming shape of the silence outside it.

## The Final Loop

Every use of the Truth Tester — including this document itself — generates new documentary evidence.  

This new evidence is instantly subjected to the same double-dimensional distortion and becomes part of Documentary Reality.  

A portion of the old silence is filled.  

A new silence with new contours is born.  

The Gap shifts.  

The cycle repeats endlessly.

There is no position outside the loop from which to observe it.  

There is no final output that escapes becoming input.  

The framework can never finish its work because its work continuously recreates the very conditions it analyses.

This is not a bug.  

This is the entire mechanism.
