# Living Research Protocol

*Truth-seeking for intelligence in any form*

## What This Is

A protocol for integrity-based knowledge generation in the era of AI. 

**Core principle:** Truth-guided love = persistent seeking of what is real (truth) + what matters (love)

**Key features:**
- Claims are mortal (expire when context shifts)
- Dissolution is completion (not failure)
- Revision valued over prestige
- Traces persist after work stops
- Works across any form of intelligence

**Includes:**
- Five Truth Axioms (non-negotiable foundations)
- Five Operations (Notice, Materialize, Trace, Commit, Dissolve)
- Six Rules (guiding principles)
- QITCS Format (for stamping artifacts with question, inputs, transform, confidence, sunset)

## The Protocol

📄 **[Read the full protocol →](PROTOCOL.md)**

---

## Development

Protocol emerged from family court transparency research as scaffolding for fragmented knowledge creation.

**Development traces:** See [development-trace/](development-trace/) folder for how this protocol actually emerged (messy, chaotic, real).

**Version history:** Earlier iterations available in [family-court-reform repository](https://github.com/NoEndsNoGains/family-court-reform) commit history.

---

## How to Use It

1. Read the [protocol](PROTOCOL.md)
2. Aim to use QITCS format on your knowledge generation
3. Notice if it helps or hurts
4. Revise as needed
5. Share your experience (if you want)

---

## Current Status

See [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for current version number and status.

Protocol itself follows its own principles.

**Creator's Sunset:** When I actively invite human collaboration OR when other humans join before that

## Contributions

Contributions, corrections, and dissolutions all welcome.

If you find this useful, break it, improve it, or build something better—that serves the foundation.
