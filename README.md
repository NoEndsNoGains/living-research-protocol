# Living Research Protocol
*Knowledge generation across any form of intelligence*

## What This Is
A system for creating claims with evidence that survive challenge. For any intelligence capable of truth-seeking, care, and testing across time - whether one intelligence or many working together.

**Foundation:** Truth (what's real) + Love (what matters) + Rigor (what survives) → Evidence

**Core principles:** Question before claim. Trace before trust. Fail before commit. Revision before prestige. Dissolution before drift.

**New to LRP?** [Visual Guide](LRP_Visual_Guide.md)

**Ready to use it?** [Full Protocol](PROTOCOL.md)

**Want the stories?** [The Hook](LRP_Story_1_Hook_v4.md) | [Complete Guide](LRP_Story_2_Complete_Guide_v4.md)

## Quick Start

1. **Notice** what's alive (what won't let you sleep)
2. **Document** using QITCS format: Question, Inputs, Transform, Confidence, Sunset
3. **Fail()** - break it on purpose before committing
4. **Set confidence** as skeptic's survival odds (not your optimism)
5. **Set sunset** - when does this need review?

**Time investment:** 10 min to learn, 15 min per claim to document properly.

## Status

**Version:** In Development  
**Released:** November 2025  
**Protocol Sunset:** 2026-11-01 OR when 3 researchers adopt it OR when unused for 3 months

Looking for researchers willing to test LRP on real work and report what breaks.
