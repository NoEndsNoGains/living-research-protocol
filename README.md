# Living Research Protocol
*Knowledge generation across any form of intelligence*

---

## What This Is

A system for creating claims with evidence that survive challenge.

**For any intelligence capable of truth-seeking, care, and testing across time** - whether one intelligence or many working together.

**Foundation:** Truth (what's real) + Love (what matters) + Rigor (what survives) → Evidence

**Core principles:** Question before claim. Trace before trust. Fail before commit. Revision before prestige. Dissolution before drift.

## Quick Start

**5 steps to use LRP on your first claim:**

1. **Notice** - Name what's alive (what won't let you sleep)
2. **Materialize** - Start making something testable
3. **Develop** - Fail ↔ Trace ↔ Commit (stress test, document, establish ground - repeat as many cycles as care asks)
4. **Set sunset** - When will you review this? (date or condition)
5. **At sunset** - Extend (keep working), Revise (question changed), or Dissolve (complete)

**Time investment:** 10 min to understand, 15 min per claim to document properly.

**Evidence emerges continuously** - not at the end, but through every interaction with reality.

## QITCS Format

When documenting your work, answer five questions:

- **Question:** What are you investigating?
- **Inputs:** What sources inform this work?
- **Transform:** What methods did you apply?
- **Confidence:** What are the skeptic's survival odds? *(Not your optimism - what would your harshest qualified critic say?)*
- **Sunset:** When does this need review?

**See [Full Protocol](PROTOCOL.md) for examples and detailed guidance.**

## Current Status

**Version:** 4.1-lean  
**Released:** November 2025  
**Protocol Sunset:** 2026-11-01 OR when 3 independent researchers adopt it OR when unused for 3 months - whichever comes first

**This protocol applies to itself** - these version numbers and sunset dates were generated using LRP operations.

## Looking for Testers

We need researchers willing to:
- Test LRP on real work (not hypothetical)
- Document what works and what breaks
- Report back with evidence

**Why test?** Help validate whether this protocol actually helps generate knowledge that survives challenge.

**Interested?** Open an issue describing what you want to test it on.

## Contributing

**Contributions welcome. Corrections celebrated. Dissolutions honored.**

This protocol applies to itself:
- Updates follow the same operations (Notice → Materialize → Develop → Commit → Dissolve)
- Changes are stress-tested before committing
- Protocol will dissolve if sunset conditions met

**To contribute:**
1. Open an issue describing the problem or improvement
2. If adding/changing: show your reasoning (Trace)
3. If challenging: provide stress test scenario (Fail)
4. Pull requests welcome

## Why This Exists

Most research dies when the researcher moves on. Claims become zombie knowledge - nobody knows if they're still maintained, still valid, still relevant.

**LRP addresses this by making knowledge mortal:**
- Claims have sunsets (review dates)
- Work can dissolve cleanly (not abandoned)
- Traces persist (others can continue)
- Evidence accumulates continuously (not just at end)

**Knowledge generation happens through:**
- Operations (what you do)
- Values (what guides you)
- Environment (continuous testing)
- Evidence (continuous accumulation)
- Interaction (engagement with reality)
- Process (flow and transformation)

**See [Visual Guide](LRP_Visual_Guide.md) for six perspectives on this multidimensional reality.**
