# Living Research Protocol
*Knowledge generation for any form of intelligence*

---
## Why This Exists
Most research dies when the researcher moves on. Claims become zombie knowledge—nobody knows if they’re maintained, valid, or relevant.  
LRP makes knowledge **mortal**:

- Claims have **sunsets** (review dates — missable, not optional)  
- Work can **dissolve cleanly** (declared complete)  
- **Traces** persist (others can build on it)  
- **Evidence accumulates continuously** (captured as you go)

---
## What This Is
A system for claims with evidence that **survive challenge**.  
Works for any intelligence capable of truth-seeking, care, and testing.

**Foundation:**  
Truth (what’s real) + Love (what matters) + Rigor (what survives) → Evidence

---
## Core Principles
1. Question before claim  
2. Trace before trust  
3. Fail before commit  
4. Revise before prestige  
5. Dissolve before drift

---
## Quick Start
1. **Notice** – Name what’s alive  
2. **Materialize** – Make something testable  
3. **Develop** – Cycle: Fail ↔ Trace ↔ Commit  
4. **Set Sunset** – When to review  
5. **At Sunset** – Extend / Revise / Dissolve

---
## QITCS Format
Document with 5 elements:

- **Question**  
- **Inputs**  
- **Transform**  
- **Confidence** (skeptic’s odds)  
- **Sunset**

*See Full Protocol for examples.*
