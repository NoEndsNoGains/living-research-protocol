## Six Questions I Ask Myself (Emerging Framework)

I’m writing this down to trace what emerged.  
It might be useful — or just how my brain works.  
I don’t always use these questions. I’m inconsistent.  
But I recognise them.

They are **questions I ask myself** to notice and name what I’m seeing — or missing.

| Question | What It Helps Me See |
|----------|----------------------|
| **EXPERIENTIAL:** What are people living? | Pain, stories, feelings |
| **PATTERN:** What repeats? | Patterns, statistics, delays |
| **CREATIVE:** What works? | Fixes, templates, successes |
| **ABSENCE:** What’s missing? | Gaps, silences, absences |
| **NETWORK:** What’s connected? | Links, networks, influence |
| **ENTROPIC:** What’s dying? | Old ideas, fading myths |

### How I Use These Questions

For each lens, I also ask:  
**“Is this the same as before, or is it unique?”**

This helps me notice:

- Patterns vs. outliers  
- Typical vs. exceptional  
- What confirms vs. what challenges  

The six lenses tell me **where** to look.  
“Same or unique?” tells me **what matters** in what I see.

These aren’t a theory.  
They’re **prompts** to check my thinking.  
They live in my head — invisible until I write them down.

When I use at least one or two of them, I tend to:  
a) **Notice more** (from multiple angles)  
b) **Avoid blind spots and bias**  
c) **Decide** whether what I’m seeing fits the current picture or changes it

This supports my desire to know:  
> **“What am I missing? What is it that I don’t see — that, if I saw it, would change everything?”**

It helps me be more thorough.  
It improves my accuracy and depth in thinking.


**Status:** Personal tool. Recorded for trace. 
**Open to change.** (most possible: open to forgetting).
