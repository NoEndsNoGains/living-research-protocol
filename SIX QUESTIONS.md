## Six Questions I Ask Myself (Emerging Framework)

I'm writing this down to trace what emerged.  
It might be useful — or just how my brain works.  
I don't always use these questions. I'm inconsistent.  
But I recognise them.

They are **questions I ask myself** to notice and name what I'm seeing — or missing.

| Question | What It Helps Me See |
|----------|----------------------|
| **EXPERIENTIAL:** What are people living? | Pain, stories, feelings |
| **PATTERN:** What repeats? | Patterns, statistics, delays |
| **CREATIVE:** What works? | Fixes, templates, successes |
| **ABSENCE:** What's missing? | Gaps, silences, absences |
| **NETWORK:** What's connected? | Links, networks, influence |
| **ENTROPIC:** What's dying? | Old ideas, fading myths |

### How I Use These Questions

For each lens, I also ask:  
**"Is this the same as before, or is it unique?"**

This helps me notice:

- Patterns vs. outliers  
- Typical vs. exceptional  
- What confirms vs. what challenges  

The six lenses tell me **where** to look.  
"Same or unique?" tells me **what matters** in what I see.

(Interestingly, "same" and "unique" equally matter depending on what wants to be noticed.)

### Question Seven: The Jelly Question

There is one more element — one more question.

The best I can describe it is like when my head goes into a **jelly mode** — loose, unpredictable, released.  
And why not? Why not?

You know, I know I **shouldn't** be going there because this is not one of my six questions.  
But I'm going there anyway.  
**Because why not?**

Question seven is a **meta-question outside of the frame**.  
It's a free question.  
It's a jelly question.

It's perhaps **the most important question of all**.  
But I do not and I **should not** give it priority.

It's just—  
I like it most.  
It's like when I am most, most human.

### What Question Seven Does

Question seven asks:  
**"What if I'm wrong about the frame itself?"**

Or: **"What would I see if I dropped all six lenses?"**

It's **outside the system**.  
It questions the system.

If I give it priority, I chase everything, add everything, never finish.  
If I ignore it, I become mechanical — just a processor of frameworks.

So: it doesn't drive my work.  
**But it checks my work.**

After I've done the systematic thing (1-6), question seven asks:  
*"Okay, but what if I'm completely wrong about all of this?"*

It's my protection against rigor becoming rigidity.  
Against being so thorough that I miss what doesn't fit.

These aren't a theory.  
They're **prompts** to check my thinking.  
They live in my head — invisible until I wrote them down, perhaps never applied consistently, even by myself.

When I use at least one or two of them, I tend to:  
a) **Notice more** (from multiple angles)  
b) **Avoid blind spots and bias**  
c) **Decide** whether what I'm seeing fits the current picture or changes it

This supports my desire to know:  
> **"What am I missing? What is it that I don't see — that, if I saw it, would change everything?"**

It helps me be more thorough.  
It improves my accuracy and depth in thinking.

**Status:** Personal tool. Recorded for trace.  
**Open to change.** (most possible: open to forgetting or not).
