# Living Research Protocol

*Truth-seeking for intelligence in any form*

---

## Manifesto

**Notice what's alive. Trace what you make. Dissolve when it stops serving.**

---

## Foundation

**Truth-Guided Love**

*persistent seeking of: what is real (truth) + what matters (love)*

- **Truth** = falsifiable, updatable signal
- **Love** = sustained attention + resource flow
- **Metric** = revision velocity > prestige velocity

*Truth requires error. Intelligence is distributed. Truth has lifespan. Attention is finite. Communication enables learning.*

---

## The Five Truth Axioms
*(non-negotiable)*

1. **Truth Requires Error Correction** — You cannot know truth without discovering error
2. **Intelligence Is Distributed** — No single intelligence holds the complete picture
3. **Truth Has Lifespan** — Claims expire when context or evidence shifts
4. **Attention Is Finite** — Energy must flow, not freeze
5. **Communication Enables Learning** — Reasoning can cross intelligences

---

## The Five Operations
*(agent-agnostic, runnable)*

| Operation | Does |
|-----------|------|
| `Notice()` | Flag salience: pain, anomaly, curiosity, gap, dream *(whatever calls your attention to investigate)* |
| `Materialize()` | Build + document testable artifact |
| `Trace()` | Show full path: inputs → transform → output (trace persists) |
| `Commit()` | Stamp confidence + sunset |
| `Dissolve()` | Release when sunset hits *(sunset triggers review: extend if active, dissolve if energy moved, or revise if question shifted)* — work stops — learning persists |

---

## The Six Rules

1. **Source before stance**
2. **Question before claim**
3. **Trace before trust**
4. **Revision before prestige**
5. **Dissolution before drift**
6. **Notice before assertion**

---

## Essential Declarations
*(Start when you begin; update as you learn; complete when you finish or pause)*

**QITCS format:**

- **Question:** What are you investigating? *(May evolve as you discover)*
- **Inputs:** What sources inform this work? *(Add as you use them)*
- **Transform:** What methods/reasoning did you apply? *(Describe as you go)*
- **Confidence:** What are the skeptic's survival odds? *(See below)*
- **Sunset:** When does this claim expire or need review? *(Can be date, condition, or energy shift)*

---

### Understanding Confidence

**Confidence = Skeptic's Survival Odds**

Confidence is NOT how sure you are about your claim.  
Confidence IS the probability your claim survives challenge from the harshest *qualified* skeptic.

**How to determine:**
1. Complete your QITS (Question, Inputs, Transform, Sunset)
2. Identify the harshest qualified critic in your field
   - Someone with domain expertise who could legitimately challenge you
   - NOT trolls or those rejecting all evidence
3. Ask: "What probability would THEY assign that my claim survives their best counter-argument?"
4. That probability = your confidence

**For different research types:**
- **Qualitative research:** Imagine expert who questions your evidence/logic
- **Statistical research:** Maps to replication odds and p-values
- **Theoretical research:** Survival odds until empirical test
- **Solo researchers:** Simulate the devil's advocate

**Format:**
```yaml
confidence: 0.65 [0.55-0.75]
  # [Identified skeptic]'s survival odds given [specific challenge]
```

**Alternatively, express by claim component:**
```yaml
uncertainties_and_confidence:
  High confidence (proven/documented): [what you've established]
  Moderate confidence (theory-supported): [what you've argued]
  Low confidence (untested hypothesis): [what you're predicting]
  Unknown (outside scope): [what you cannot know yet]
```

**Key principle:** Confidence is not self-assessed optimism.  
It's how hard your claim can be hit and still stand.

### Example QITCS
```yaml
question: Can ease of transcript access serve as pathway to family court transformation?

inputs: [HMCTS procedures, FPR rules, case law, FOI data, learning theory, 
         practitioner accounts, user experiences]

transform: Five-layer triangulation, design failure mapping, 
           least-resistance reform proposals

confidence: 0.5 [0.4-0.6]
  # HMCTS skeptic's survival odds:
  # HIGH (0.9): Barriers proven through convergent evidence
  # MODERATE (0.7): Transcripts necessary for learning (theory-supported)
  # LOW (0.5): Accessibility alone triggers transformation (untested)
  # Note: Overall confidence reflects weakest link in causal chain

OR expressed as:

uncertainties_and_confidence:
  High confidence: Transcript barriers exist and prevent transparency
  Moderate confidence: Transcripts necessary infrastructure for learning
  Low confidence: Accessibility alone will trigger transformation
  Unknown: Political will; whether people will analyze available transcripts

sunset: 2027-06-01 OR when HMCTS reforms implemented OR when transformation 
        evidence emerges OR when court case concludes OR when energy moves 
        OR when other contributors join
```

## Why Living Research Protocol Needs to Exist

*This protocol enables what is alive to stay alive in the most effective ways.*

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Truth trapped in time | Mortal claims |
| Intelligence wasted | AI + human co-creation |
| Error punished | Dissolution celebrated |

---

## On Dissolution

Dissolution is not erasure. It is completion.

Work dissolves when:
- Problem solved (knowledge persists in reality)
- Question discovered wrong (learning persists)
- Energy moves elsewhere (exploration persists)

Success includes:
- Solutions found
- Dead ends mapped
- Wandering that taught what was needed

The work stops. The trace remains. The learning lives.

When energy moves, active work stops but trace persists. Like open source maintainers stepping down: work remains public, others may continue if valuable, no pretense of ongoing maintenance. The trace is the asset. Honest handoff enables distributed continuation.

Dissolution serves the foundation: truth-seeking through love.

## How to Start

1. **Begin QITCS when you start work** - even with incomplete information
2. **Update as you learn** - refine question, add inputs, note uncertainties
3. **Show your reasoning** - document methods and thought process
4. **Identify the skeptic** - who could challenge this most credibly?
5. **Set confidence as skeptic's survival odds** - not your optimism
6. **Set sunset** - when to review (may not be clear initially)
7. **Let others improve it** - invite critique and collaboration
8. **Update when wrong** - revision > prestige

---

## Current Status

**Version:** 3.0  
**Released:** November 2025  
**Dissolves:** When superseded OR when creator's sunset reached

**Creator's Sunset:** When actively inviting human collaboration OR when humans join organically—whichever happens first

**Major changes from v2.0:**
- Clarified when to fill QITCS (start/update/complete cycle)
- Redefined Confidence as "skeptic's survival odds" (not self-assessment)
- Added alternative format: uncertainties by confidence level

---

**Contributions welcome. Corrections celebrated. Dissolutions honored.**

*This protocol is living research. It will dissolve when its purpose is fulfilled.*
