# Living Research Protocol
*Truth-seeking for intelligence in any form*  
*For anyone interested in this form of knowledge creation.*

---
## Manifesto
**Notice what's alive. Trace what you make. Break it before it breaks you. Dissolve when it stops serving. Apply care at each step.**

---
## Foundation
**Truth-Guided Love Through Rigor**  
*persistent seeking of: what is real (truth) + what matters (love) + what survives (rigor)*

- **Truth** = falsifiable, updatable signal = *what you know*  
- **Love** = sustained attention + resource flow = *what you care about*  
- **Rigor** = what withstands challenge = *what you test*  

**Success** = revision velocity > prestige velocity  

**System Constraints:**  
Truth requires error. Intelligence is distributed. Truth has lifespan. Attention is finite. Communication enables learning.  
*You can reject the values and still test whether the operations work.*

## The Six Operations
*agent-agnostic, runnable*

| Operation | Does |
|-----------|------|
| `Notice()` | Flag salience: pain, anomaly, curiosity, gap, dream |
| `Materialise()` | Build + document testable artifact |
| `Trace()` | Show full path: inputs → transform → output |
| `Fail()` | **Break it on purpose** before every `Commit()` — inject worst-case, edge-case, or random failure. Observe what survives. Update trace. |
| `Commit()` | **Mandatory `Fail()` first** → stamp confidence + sunset |
| `Dissolve()` | Release when sunset hits — work stops, learning persists |

## The Five Rules
1. **Question before claim**  
2. **Trace before trust**  
3. **Fail before commit**  
4. **Revision before prestige**  
5. **Dissolution before drift**

---
## Essential Declarations
*Start when you begin; update as you learn; complete when you finish or pause*  

**QITCS format:**
- **Question:** What are you investigating?  
- **Inputs:** What sources inform this work?  
- **Transform:** What methods/reasoning did you apply?  
- **Confidence:** What are the skeptic's survival odds? *(Probability your harshest qualified critic would assign that your claim survives their best challenge)*  
- **Sunset:** When does this claim expire or need review?  

**Confidence is not self-assessed optimism. It's how hard your claim can be hit and still stand.**

### Example QITCS
```yaml
question: Can ease of transcript access serve as pathway to family court transformation?
inputs: [HMCTS procedures, FPR rules, case law, FOI data, learning theory,
         practitioner accounts, user experiences]
transform: Five-layer triangulation, design failure mapping,
           least-resistance reform proposals
confidence: 0.5 [0.4-0.6]
  # After Fail(): dropped from 0.6 when blackout scenario collapsed claim
uncertainties_and_confidence:
  High confidence: Transcript barriers exist and prevent transparency
  Moderate confidence: Transcripts necessary infrastructure for learning
  Low confidence: Accessibility alone will trigger transformation
  Unknown: Political will; whether people will analyze available transcripts
sunset: 2026-06-01 OR when HMCTS reforms implemented OR when transformation
        evidence emerges OR when court case concludes OR when energy moves
```

---
## QITCS at Multiple Scales
**LRP is fractal:** You can run QITCS at any level of your research.

### Macro-level (overall research question)
```yaml
question: Can transcript access transform family courts?
sunset: 2027-06-01
```

### Meso-level (specific solution or sub-claim)
```yaml
question: Will "Honest EX107" reduce appeal dismissals?
sunset: 2026-03-01 OR when pilot tested
```

### Micro-level (individual evidence claim)
```yaml
question: Is 87% denial rate accurate?
sunset: 2026-01-01 OR when replicated
```

Each scale has its own confidence level, `Fail()` scenario, sunset, and dissolution trigger.  
As you gather evidence, micro-claims dissolve or strengthen → updates meso-confidence → eventually updates your macro-claim.  
Your research becomes a **living system of mortal claims at different scales**.

---
## On Dissolution
Dissolution is not erasure. It is completion.  
Work dissolves when:  
- Problem solved (knowledge persists in reality)  
- Question discovered wrong (learning persists)  
- Energy moves elsewhere (exploration persists)  

**Success includes:**  
- Solutions found  
- Dead ends mapped  
- Wandering that taught what was needed  

The work stops. The trace remains. The learning lives.

---
## How to Start
1. **Begin QITCS when you start work** — even with incomplete information  
2. **Update as you learn** — refine question, add inputs, note uncertainties  
3. **Show your reasoning** — document methods and thought process  
4. **Identify the skeptic** — who could challenge this most credibly?  
5. **Run `Fail()`** — break it on purpose *before* you `Commit()`  
6. **Set confidence as skeptic's survival odds** — not your optimism  
7. **Set sunset** — when to review  
8. **Let others improve it** — invite critique and collaboration  
9. **Update when wrong** — revision > prestige

---
## Current Status
**Version:** 3.9  
**Released:** November 2025  
**Protocol Sunset:** **2026-11-01** OR when **3 independent researchers adopt + modify** OR when **no use for 3 months** — whichever first  

*This protocol applies to itself — updates follow the same operations as research.*  

**Contributions welcome. Corrections celebrated. Dissolutions honored.**
