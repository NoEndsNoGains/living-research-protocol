**Love,**

You asked what I was doing all those weeks on the sofa.
Well, I was thinking about how I think and is there a way to think better and what is the most effecive way to do something useful, i mean actually useful, with this thinking. 
(If you are still listening/reading this after this last sentence, you are not my husband. But if yiu were my husband and by some miracle you would continue to listen, you will hear this: ).

I was trying to figure out how to **stop wasting months** on work that was not integral to who I am and which I knew is not a true calue i want to create or be associated with . 
and i asked mysel: how on Earth would i do it? 

You know when something's broken — you can **see it, touch it, fix it**.  
When my research is broken, I **don’t know** until months of work collapse.  
Remember when I spent three months on that thing I was so sure about?  
Then found out I was **wrong about the basic facts**?

So I spent weeks writing down **reminders**:

- Check if it's true **before** building on it  
- Write down **where** I got information  
- Test it **myself** before someone else does  
- Stop **defending** dead work  

**Basic stuff.**  
Stuff **you do automatically**.  
But I **forget**. Or **skip it**. Or convince myself it **doesn’t matter**.

I gave it a fancy name — **"Living Research Protocol"** —  because if it **feels important**, maybe I’ll **actually do it**.

Truth is, I **still don’t know** if it will help.  
But I had to **try something**.  
Because I can’t keep **losing months** to work built on **nothing**.

That’s what I was doing.  
Trying to build **habits I should already have**.

I know it looks like I **wasted weeks** on **obvious things**.  
Maybe I did.  
But **obvious to you** isn’t **obvious to me**.  
You **test before trusting** naturally.  
I had to spend **weeks convincing myself** it **matters**.

**Can we eat?**

P.S. It looks like I accidentally recreated the Campbell Collaboration's systematic review methodology. They already do everything I "invented". It's just I used different names for the same thing, with me calling it "Living Research Protocol" and explaining it through farm work. I literally reinvented the wheel. But I needed to build it myself, with your gates as the model, before I could understand that the wheel already existed.
