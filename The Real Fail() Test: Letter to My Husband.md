# Love,

You asked what I was doing all those weeks on the sofa.  
Well, I was thinking — about *how* I think,  
and whether there’s a way to think better.  
How to do something actually **useful** with all that thinking —  
not just busy, not just clever — but useful in a way that *matters.*

(And if you’re still reading this after that sentence, you’re definitely not my husband.  
But if you were — and by some miracle you kept listening — you’d hear this:)

I was trying to figure out how to **stop wasting months** on work that isn’t truly part of me —  
work that doesn’t feel alive,  
and isn’t the kind of value I want to create or stand for.

So I asked myself: *How on earth do I stop doing that?*

That’s when I came up with something some people might call *fluff.*  
But it wasn’t fluff to me.  
It was the kind of fluff **without which I couldn’t move even one tiny inch.**  
A sort of **promise to myself** —  
to do work I care about, whether that’s puddles or family-court reform —  
and to build it on **truth,**  
not because I *want* it to be true,  
but because it’s grounded in **rigour.**

Yes — obviously — it finally became obvious to me  
that my work requires **honest integrity** with who I am.  
I just can’t do work anymore that isn’t *me* — in either content or approach.

Think of it as the **foundation** of my thinking —  
a quiet **decision-making guide** I use whenever I ask myself:  
*Should I, or shouldn’t I, engage in this project?*

I thought, *great — I’m done!*  
But then, of course, I met another challenge.

You know when something’s broken — you can **see it, touch it, fix it.**  
But when my thing (usually research), even when I’ve chosen it with full awareness, is broken —  
I **don’t know** until **months collapse.**

My thinking is invisible, chaotic, fragmented, emotional, biased — and endlessly forgetful.

Remember when I spent three months on that thing I was so sure about?  
Then found out I was **wrong about the basic facts?**

That’s when I realised something else:  
I need **scaffolding** for my thinking — something to hold onto.  
I need instructions, or at least better **signposts,**  
for how to think in a slightly more structured way.

That’s not to say I want to lose what I call *freedom thinking* — not at all.  
It’s just that sometimes I need help keeping my bouncy thoughts  
a bit more organised, so I can decide which to keep and which to let go.  
(If you are my husband, you’ve definitely dropped off by now.)

Anyway — if I want to develop thinking I *care for,*  
thinking that actually matters, I concluded this:

Once something has truly caught my attention — enough for me to explore it further —  
I must **record what I’ve got,**  
and **stress it against itself,**  
and **stress it against myself,**  
until what’s left is **undeniable.**  
Only then do I get to where I needed to go.

So I started writing down **reminders:**

- Check if it’s true **before** building on it.  
- Write down **where** I got the information.  
- Test it **myself** before someone else does.  
- Stop **defending** dead work.  
  *(If I’d been a better student, I’d know that’s exactly what they teach in research-design classes.)*

**Basic stuff.**  
Stuff **you do automatically.**  
But I **forget.** Or **skip it.** Or convince myself it **doesn’t matter.**

So I gave it a name — **“Living Research Protocol.”**  
Because if it **sounds important,** maybe I’ll **actually do it.**

Truth is, I **still don’t know** if it will help.  
But I had to **try something,**  
because I can’t keep **losing months** to work built on **nothing.**

That’s what I was doing —  
trying to build **habits I should already have.**

I know it looks like I **wasted weeks** on **obvious things.**  
Maybe I did.  
But what’s **obvious to you** isn’t **obvious to me.**  
You **test before trusting** — naturally.  
I had to spend **weeks convincing myself** that it **matters.**

**Can we eat?**

### P.S.

It turns out I accidentally recreated what already exists.  
Shame on me!  

Apparently, people already do everything I “invented.”  
How disappointing — to realise I’m not as original as I hoped to be  
(not to mention, just late to the table).

I just used different names — called it the **“Living Research Protocol”**  
and explained it through your **farm work.**  It’s really just your way of farming, translated into my language: you work with what’s real — what grows, what eats, what fails — while I try to do the same with thought. We both test for life.
So yes, I reinvented the wheel.  
But I needed to build it myself — **with you as my tester** —  
before I could understand that the wheel already existed. And now, with my slightly more corrected vision of what I’ve created,  
comes the hardest test of all — the **usability test.**  
Ah, but this time I don’t have to worry:  
if I’ve created a zombie,  
it already has a **termination date.**  
Phew.
