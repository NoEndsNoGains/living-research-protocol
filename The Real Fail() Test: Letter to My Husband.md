Love,

You asked what I was doing all those weeks on the sofa.
Well, I was thinking — about how I think,
and whether there’s a way to think better.
How to do something actually useful with all that thinking —
not just busy, not just clever — but useful in a way that matters.

(And if you’re still reading this after that sentence, you’re definitely not my husband.
But if you were — and by some miracle you kept listening — you’d hear this:)

I was trying to figure out how to stop wasting months on work that isn’t truly part of me —
work that looks productive but doesn’t feel alive,
and isn’t the kind of value I want to create or stand for.

So I asked myself: how on Earth do I stop doing that?

That’s when I came up with something some people might call fluff.
But it wasn’t fluff to me.
It was the kind of fluff without which I couldn’t move even one tiny inch.
A sort of promise to myself —
to do work I care about,
to build it on truth —
not because I want it to be true,
but because it’s grounded in rigour.

Think of it as the foundation of my thinking —
a quiet decision-making guide I use whenever I ask myself:
Should I, or shouldn’t I, engage in this project?

I thought, great, I’m done!
But then, of course, I met another challenge.

You know when something’s broken — you can see it, touch it, fix it.
But when my thing (usually research), even when I’ve chosen it with full awareness, is broken —
I don’t know until months collapse.

Remember when I spent three months on that thing I was so sure about?
Then found out I was wrong about the basic facts?

That’s when I realised something else:
If I want to develop thinking I care for,
the kind that actually matters,
then I have to record what I’ve got,
and stress it against itself,
and stress it against myself,
until what’s left is undeniable.

So I started writing down reminders:
	•	Check if it’s true before building on it.
	•	Write down where I got the information.
	•	Test it myself before someone else does.
	•	Stop defending dead work.

Basic stuff.
Stuff you do automatically.
But I forget. Or skip it. Or convince myself it doesn’t matter.

So I gave it a name — “Living Research Protocol.”
Because if it sounds important, maybe I’ll actually do it.

Truth is, I still don’t know if it will help.
But I had to try something,
because I can’t keep losing months to work built on nothing.

That’s what I was doing —
trying to build habits I should already have.

I know it looks like I wasted weeks on obvious things.
Maybe I did.
But what’s obvious to you isn’t obvious to me.
You test before trusting — naturally.
I had to spend weeks convincing myself that it matters.

Can we eat?

Your wife,

P.S. It turns out I accidentally recreated what already exists.
Shame on me!

Apparently, it’s the Campbell Collaboration’s systematic review methodology.
They already do everything I “invented.”
How disappointing — to realise I’m not as original as I hoped to be.

I just used different names — called it the “Living Research Protocol” and explained it through your farm work.
So yes, I reinvented the wheel.
But I needed to build it myself — with you as my tester —
before I could understand that the wheel already existed.
