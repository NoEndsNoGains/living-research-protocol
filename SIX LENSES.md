## Six Analytical Lenses (Working Framework)

While researching family court transcript systems, I noticed evidence consistently appeared through six distinct perspectives. I'm documenting this pattern to trace whether it's a useful framework or just how my brain organised information.

### The Six Lenses

| Lens | What to Look For | Question | Example from Research |
|------|------------------|----------|----------------------|
| **🌊 Experiential** | Lived reality, feelings, stories | *What are people living?* | "I waited 8 weeks for transcripts" |
| **🔍 Pattern** | Recurrence, statistics, trends | *What repeats?* | 42-day average delay across cases |
| **⚡ Creative** | Solutions that work | *What actually helps?* | Email template reduced wait times |
| **🕳️ Absence** | Gaps, silences, omissions | *What's missing?* | No children's voices in 100 appeals |
| **🔗 Network** | Connections, relationships | *What's linked?* | Same judge-expert pairings |
| **💫 Entropic** | Dissolution, obsolescence | *What's dying?* | "Parental alienation" discourse declining |

### Why Document This?

When I analysed different sources—forum posts, judicial decisions, professional guidance, FOI data, and gaps in records—these six types kept emerging. This isn't a claim of universal truth or complete categorization. It's **triangulation made explicit**: naming which angle you're looking from makes research more traceable and testable.

**Key principles:**
- No lens is "more true" than another (a parent's story = as valid as statistical data)
- More lenses = more robust understanding
- Missing lenses = blind spots
- Categories themselves remain open to challenge

### How to Use

1. When collecting evidence, ask each lens's question
2. Tag which lens(es) each piece of evidence comes through
3. Note when something fits none of them (signals new thinking needed)
4. Document which lenses are absent from your analysis

### Testing

After practical use, this framework will either:
- Prove useful and be refined
- Reveal missing/unnecessary categories
- Be replaced by something better

**Status:** Hypothesis. Documented for tracing, testing, and improvement.
Sunset: As per Family Court Reform

**Invitation:** If you notice additional lenses, or these don't work for your research, propose changes. This is designed to evolve.
