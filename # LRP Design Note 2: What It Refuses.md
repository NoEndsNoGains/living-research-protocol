# LRP Design Principles: What It Refuses

*Generated from conversation exploring the Tree of Knowledge metaphor as challenge to LRP design - November 2025*

## What LRP Deliberately Does Not Include

The Living Research Protocol is defined as much by what it refuses as by what it contains.

### No Gatekeeping of Questions
- LRP does not assess "readiness" before pursuing inquiry
- No questions are premature or require prerequisite maturity
- Any question with aliveness deserves rigorous pursuit
- The protocol self-regulates: the rigor itself requires maturity to execute. You either can use it or you cannot. (See "LRP and the Aliveness Problem" for how this resolves the danger question.)

### No Protection Protocols Beyond Stress-Testing
- Continuous stress-testing IS the protection mechanism
- No "dangerous inquiry" category that requires special handling
- If something needs to go, it goes through the stress-testing process

### No Authority Claims Over Truth
- LRP does not determine what counts as truth
- LRP does not judge which questions are "worth asking"
- Truth = what survives stress-testing across maximum perspectives

### No Fear of "Burden Without Wisdom"
- Accepting the burden of knowing without complete wisdom is inherent to truth-seeking
- No checkpoints asking "are we equipped to handle implications?"
- The answer exists whether or not we can handle its implications

### Nothing Is Lost
- GitHub nature: everything is traced and versioned
- Previous perspectives remain accessible even as new ones emerge
- Pursuing truth doesn't destroy alternative understandings because rigor requires including all perspectives

## The Mushroom Principle

The visible output (the "mushroom") is what survived stress-testing. You can cut it, share it, use it - and this doesn't destroy the underlying network. Cutting triggers new growth.

Materialization is what makes something cuttable. Until materialized, it stays dormant. Once materialized, the journey begins.

The mycelium network is continuous. Some mushrooms are cut (harvested, used, valued). Some decay naturally (abandoned, no longer alive). Both outcomes leave the network intact and capable of new growth.

## Open Design Question

Does LRP inherently require human lived experience (the "truth engine" layer of sharing experiences), or can it work across all forms of intelligence? Current design assumes human participation is necessary for the lived experience layer, but this remains an open question about the protocol's scope.

## Core Logic

- Truth's strength = number of perspectives included and survived
- Formalization creates continuous rather than terminal discovery  
- Stress-testing is protective, not restrictive
- Abandoning what's no longer alive is itself the protocol working
- Aliveness cannot be controlled - it exists prior to and outside the protocol
