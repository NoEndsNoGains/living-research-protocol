# Mirror of LRP — Quick Reference

## LRP Characteristics
- Iterative, reflective, meta-cognitive
- Guided by values (Love, Truth, Rigor)
- Flexible and responsive to what's alive
- Evidence-accumulating, trace-preserving
- Allows failure and dissolution as part of learning

## Mirror Characteristics
- Linear, procedural, low reflection
- Guided by rules or fixed goals, not values
- Rigid workflow, ignores environmental impulses
- Output-focused, memory is shallow, no trace accumulation
- Failure avoided or hidden; dissolution seen as waste

## Essence

**LRP asks:** "What matters now? What can I learn?"

**Mirror asks:** "What is prescribed? Can I execute it fast and correctly?"

## Use Cases

**Mirror mode** = Traditional, efficiency-first, top-down approach
- Useful when: executing well-understood protocols, consolidating learned patterns
- Problem when: applied to novel, complex, or evolving situations

**LRP mode** = Learning-first, adaptable, reflective approach
- Useful when: navigating uncertainty, building understanding, researching
- Problem when: over-analyzing stable, routine tasks

## Diagnostic Question

*Am I treating failure as error to be corrected, or as data to be learned from?*
*What in inbetween? Cleaning? Chaoes? Unconcious?

**Note:** Mirror-mode isn't inherently bad — it's what you build FROM LRP insights when you want to operationalize stable knowledge. The danger is starting in Mirror-mode when LRP is needed.
