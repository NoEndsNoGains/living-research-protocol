# LRP Design Note 1: Why LRP Doesn't Find Your Question

*Personal note on protocol architecture - November 11, 2025*

---

## The Observation

The Living Research Protocol is extraordinarily effective at **executing research** once you know what to work on. It assumes you already have your question when you reach `Notice()` and `Materialise()`.

But what if you don't know what's worth noticing? What if you're lost about what matters?

LRP has no process for **finding your question**.

---

## The Gap Identified

**What LRP provides:**
- Operations for building testable artifacts (`Materialise`)
- Methods for stress-testing claims (`Fail`)
- Frameworks for tracing reasoning (`Trace`)
- Discipline for time-bound commitments (`Commit`, `Sunset`)
- Protocol for completion (`Dissolve`)

**What LRP assumes:**
- You already know what you care about (Love)
- You've identified what's salient (Notice)
- You're ready to take action (Materialise)

**The missing layer:**

LRP operates at the "Beyond Meta" stage—it's the system for **doing the work** after you've found your meta-question. It doesn't help you **find the meta-question** in the first place.

---

## The Question Hierarchy

Through dialogue exploration, three distinct levels emerged:

### Level 1: Questions Within a System
**"What should we do?"**
- Seeks solutions within existing frameworks
- Accepts the system's premises
- Generates answers, not inquiry into foundations

### Level 2: Meta-Questions About the System
**"By what authority...?" / "For whose benefit...?"**
- Interrogates the system's justification
- Questions who has the right to act
- Examines power dynamics and motivations
- Synthesizes multiple analytical perspectives (legal, ethical, psychological, technological, societal, personal)

### Level 3: Beyond Meta (Where LRP Begins)
**Three interrelated practices:**

**A. Inquiry into the Inquirer**
- "Why am I the one asking this?"
- "What is my unstated intent?"
- "What biases led me to this specific question?"

**B. Inquiry into the Axioms**
- "What fundamental concepts am I taking for granted?"
- "What are my unexamined assumptions?"
- QITCS format operationalizes this

**C. Move to Praxis**
- "What does this knowledge demand of me?"
- "How must I change my behavior?"
- The Six Operations operationalize this

## Why This Stays Out of the Protocol

### 1. It Would Violate "Process, Not Values"
Adding a "question-finding" module would make LRP prescriptive about **what to care about**. The protocol's power comes from being agent-agnostic about values while being rigorous about process.

### 2. It Would Break Agent-Agnosticism
Finding your question is deeply contextual, subjective, and value-laden. An AI, a research team, or an individual each finds questions differently. The protocol can't be universal if it prescribes this stage.

### 3. It Would Turn Operations into Philosophy
LRP's operations are **mechanical and runnable**:
- `Materialise()`: Build artifact
- `Fail()`: Stress-test it
- `Trace()`: Show your reasoning

Adding "Find your question" would introduce:
- "Examine your soul"
- "Interrogate your biases"
- "Synthesize worldviews"

These aren't operations; they're introspective practices that can't be standardized.

### 4. LRP Already Has an Answer
The protocol **declares** its answer to the meta-question through its Foundation:

**By what authority do we generate knowledge?**

> "By the authority of a process that is transparent (Trace), humble (Fail), mortal (Sunset), and generative (Materialise)."

The Foundation (Truth, Love, Rigor) is the protocol's chosen answer. Users either adopt it or adapt it, but LRP doesn't debate it.

---

## The Practical Pattern: How Questions Get Found

From conversation analysis, the question-finding process involves:

### 1. Rejecting Premature Answers
- Don't start by seeking solutions
- Start by seeking the right question
- Answers to wrong questions create wasted effort

### 2. Interrogating Your Analytical Lens
- Are you asking as a Scientist? Architect? Ethicist? 
- Each perspective generates different sub-questions
- The meta-question must sit above all of them

### 3. Moving Through Levels
**Pattern observed:**

1. Start with a problem ("How do we protect children in published records?")
2. Elevate to system interrogation ("By what authority do we publish a child's reality?")
3. Examine your own standing ("Why am I asking this? What do I assume?")
4. Commit to action (LRP begins here)

### 4. The Critical Shift
The moment you move from:
- **"What's the answer?"** → **"What's the question?"**
- **"How do I solve this?"** → **"By what authority do I act?"**
- **"What should the system do?"** → **"What must I do?"**

...you're ready for LRP.

## The Distinction: Wish, Care, Love

Through dialogue, a framework emerged for distinguishing what matters:

**WISH = `Notice()`**
- Passive observation
- Low-energy curiosity
- No commitment required
- A wish you never act on stays a wish

**CARE = `Materialise()`**
- First decision to take action
- Commitment of real energy/resources
- Moving from idea to testable artifact
- First proof of what matters

**LOVE = `Revise()` after `Fail()`**
- Persistence through breaking
- When work fails, you choose: Dissolve or Revise?
- Love is the energy that drives the revision loop
- Willingness to be wrong repeatedly

**Key insight:**

Action is the only non-negotiable evidence of what you truly care about. Talk is cheap; allocation of finite resources (time, attention, energy) reveals priority.

This framework helps distinguish between:
- "I wish someone would fix this" (Notice only)
- "I care enough to try" (Materialise)
- "I love this enough to persist when it breaks" (Revise after Fail)

## What This Note Is For

### For Future Protocol Designers
If you're tempted to add a "question-finding" module to LRP:
- Remember this would make it philosophical, not operational
- It would break agent-agnosticism
- It would serve values, not process
- The protocol's power comes from what it **doesn't** say

### For LRP Users Who Feel Lost
If you don't know what to work on:

1. You're at the **pre-LRP stage**
2. You need to do "meta-question" work first
3. This isn't a protocol failure—it's working as designed
4. LRP begins when you're ready for praxis, not before

### For Those Building Supplementary Materials
A "Finding Your Question" guide would be valuable as:
- **Case studies** showing the question-finding journey
- **Frameworks** for moving through question levels
- **Prompts** for interrogating your own position
- **Examples** of meta-question formulation

But these belong in **supplementary materials**, not the core protocol.

## The Test for "Beyond Meta" Readiness

Ask yourself:

**Have you completed meta-question work?**
- [ ] Do I know by what authority I'm acting?
- [ ] Have I examined my own biases and intent?
- [ ] Have I identified my foundational assumptions?
- [ ] Can I articulate what I care about enough to stress-test?

**Are you ready for praxis?**
- [ ] Am I ready to build testable artifacts?
- [ ] Am I willing to deliberately break my own work?
- [ ] Will I revise when proven wrong?
- [ ] Can I accept that my claims are mortal?

**If yes to both sections** → You're ready for LRP

**If no** → You need the "prequel" work first

---

## Where This Matters

This distinction protects LRP from mission creep. The protocol could easily expand into:
- Philosophy of inquiry
- Psychology of motivation
- Sociology of knowledge production
- Ethics of research practice

All valuable domains, but **not the protocol's job**.

LRP is a "Beyond Meta Operating System." It's the high-performance toolkit you use after you've climbed the mountain and decided to build. It's not the map for finding which mountain to climb.

**Rule 5 applies:** "Dissolution before drift"

The protocol stays operationally focused by **not** solving every problem. It solves one problem extraordinarily well: generating rigorous knowledge once you know what you care about.

---

## Status

**Design insight captured. Not for protocol inclusion.**

**Recommendation:** Create supplementary material:
- Case study document showing question-finding process
- Guide titled "Finding Your Question: The Prequel to LRP"
- Examples of meta-question formulation across domains

**Next:** Continue using LRP for what it does best—executing research with integrity. Accept that "what to research" is a different (essential, but different) challenge.

---

**Note:** This design note itself demonstrates LRP in action:
- `Notice()`: Protocol assumes question is found
- `Materialise()`: Drafted "question-finding module" idea
- `Trace()`: Showed reasoning for why it doesn't belong
- `Fail()`: Tested against agent-agnosticism, broke
- `Commit()`: Status: Not for protocol inclusion
- `Dissolve()`: Work stops, learning persists in this note
